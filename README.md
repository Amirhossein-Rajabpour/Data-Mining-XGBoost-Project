# Data Mining XGBoost Project
In this project a dataset about `Diabetes` was given and we had to preprocess the data and then create a `XGBoost` model with given parameters. In the final step we used `GridSearchCV` to evaluate different parameters and finally choose the best parameters. At the end there are some visualizations for understanding the resaluts better.
